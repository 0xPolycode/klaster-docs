# Getting started with Klaster

This is a simple tutorial demonstrating how to get started with the Klaster SDK and how to execute your first Interchain 
Transaction (or `iTx`).

## Tutorial outcomes 

- The ability to pay gas in ERC20 tokens on any chain, while executing transaction(s) on any other (cross-chain gas abstraction)

- The ability to execute multiple transcations on multiple blockchains, with a single off-chain signature

## Steps 
::::steps

### Install Klaster and viem

```bash
npm i klaster-sdk viem
```

### Setup mock accounts

In order to get started with this tutorial, you're going to need a private key which will be able to sign the `iTx` hash.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:createmockaccounts]
```

### Initialize Klaster

Initialize the Klaster SDK. In order to start the Klaster SDK, you need to provide it with `accountInitData`. This is the
information which Klaster needs to derive a counterfactural `ERC4337` Smart Contract Accounts. Klaster supports various Account
Vendors and you can check the supported options in the _Accounts_ section of the docs.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:initKlaster]
```

### Send assets to the Smart Contract Account

Once Klaster has derived the address of your Smart Contract Account, you need to send some assets there in order to be able to
execute the iTx. These accounts are `gasless` - which means that you don't have to send any `ETH` or `MATIC` or other native
token to them. The transaction fees can be paid in `USDC`, `USDT`, `LINK`, `stETH` and many other tokens...

### Encode a test/mock transaction

For this getting started tutorial, you will encode a simple _send ether_ transaction. The transaction sends the ether back to 
its sender - so it's a useless transaction. It's just meant to demonstrate how to encode an iTx

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:encodeMockTx]
```

### Build your Interchain Transaction

Now, you have everything you need to build your Interchain Transaction. Take the `sendETH` transactions you've encoded and call
the `singleTx` helper function in the `steps` property of the iTx. 

**Steps** is an array of `TxBatch` objects. Every `TxBatch` object contains the following:

- `rawTx[]` - an array of encoded EVM transaction to execute
- `chainId` - the chain on which to execute those transactions

Every iTx contains an array of `TxBatch` objects.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:buildItx]
```

### Fetch a quote from the Klaster Node

In order to execute your `iTx`, you must pay a Klaster Node some transaction fee. The Klaster Nodes can accept any token they
like or even execute the transaction for zero payment. 

:::info
The SDK and the node communicate through an Auction system, where the 
SDK receives multiple offers from nodes and chooses the best one. This part of the protocol and SDK is still in development 
(planned release for Q4/2024 - Q1/2025). 

Right now, the SDK communicates with a single node (as set out in the `nodeUrl`) 
parameter. The information about which networks and tokens the current node implementation supports can be found [here](./supported-networks-tokens.mdx)
:::

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:getQuote]
```

### Signing the iTx

If you're satisfied with the quoted price by the node, you can give permission to the Klaster Node to execute the transactions
contained within the `iTx` by signing the iTx hash with your private key. 

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:signMessage]
```

### Exeuting the iTx

Once the user has signed the iTx - you can pass the signed hash to the node, together with the `Quote` - by calling the `execute`
function on the SDK.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/itx.ts:fetchResult]
```

### Tracking the progress of the transaction

In order to track the progress of your executed tranaction, you can use the [Klaster Explorer](./explorer).
