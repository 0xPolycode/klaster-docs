# Klaster Protocol Technical Summary

## Overview

Klaster Protocol is a chain abstraction framework that enables the execution of complex cross-chain transaction bundles with a single user signature. It introduces a Transaction Commitment Layer between users/dApps and multiple blockchain networks, facilitating seamless interaction across different chains.

## Key Concepts

### 1. iTx (Interchain Transaction) bundles

- Series of (possibly dependent) transactions spanning across multiple chains
- Represented as a Merkle Tree of UserOps
- Defined by a unique Merkle Root hash (iTx hash)

### 2. Transaction Commitment Layer

- Network of Klaster Nodes
- Provides execution guarantees
- Orchestrates iTx execution across multiple blockchain networks

## Core Components

### Smart Accounts - iTx Module

- Standardized ERC-7579 module for smart contract accounts
- Enables single signature approval for entire iTx bundles
- Compatible with existing smart account wallets

### Klaster Nodes

Responsibilities:
- Estimating iTx fees & responding to quote requests
- Committing to iTx execution
- Executing fully signed iTx bundles

Node Selection Process:
1. Nodes provide quotes for iTx execution
2. User/dApp selects best quote based on cost and node reputation
3. Selected node commits to iTx execution
4. User signs the iTx bundle
5. Node executes the iTx bundle

### Meta Paymaster and Multichain Gas Refunds

- Nodes act as Meta Paymasters, accepting payment in one token/chain and executing transactions across multiple chains
- Utilizes ERC-4337 EntryPoint for UserOp routing
- Implements gas refunds for overpaid transactions

### Optimistic iTx Execution

- Nodes determine optimal execution order through simulation
- Executes UserOps when simulations yield 0 REVERT opcodes
- Incentivized by diminishing success tips

## Integration

- SDK available for dApp/Wallet developers
- Enables efficient building of chain-abstracted applications
- Neutral approach, compatible with various bridges and AA wallet providers

## Use Cases

- Chain-abstracted versions of existing dApps (e.g., AAVE)
- Streamlined checkout flows
- Easier onboarding to SocialFi L2/L3 apps
- Single-chain dApps attracting users from various chains

## Security Considerations

- Users maintain full control of funds through AA wallets
- Nodes can be slashed for failing to execute committed iTx bundles
- Security reduced to the security of bridges used for asset transfers between chains

## Future Developments

- Decentralization phase including slashing and multichain staking
- Public node implementation for verification and customization
- Potential integration with intent solver networks
