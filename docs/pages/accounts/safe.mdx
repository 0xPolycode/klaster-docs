## Initializing a Safe Account

To initialize the Klaster SDK with a Safe account you can use the following function:

```ts
const klaster = await initKlaster({
  accountInitData: loadSafeV141Account({
    signers: ["0xSIGNER"],
    threshold: 1n,
  }),
  nodeUrl: "https://<node-url>",
});
```

:::info
The signers information is used to derive the account address. If the signers change, you should keep using the initial
signers information which was used to create the Safe account.
