# Introduction to Klaster

Klaster is a revolutionary P2P network standard that enables guaranteed conditional execution of transactions across one or more independent blockchains with a single off-chain signature. In an increasingly fragmented blockchain ecosystem, Klaster aims to solve key challenges around usability, asset fragmentation, and cross-chain interactions.

Klaster is not a new blockchain, but a protocol layer that enhances existing blockchain infrastructure.

## What is Klaster?

Klaster is a comprehensive protocol layer designed to sit on top of existing blockchains. It consists of three main components:

1. A set of smart contracts deployed on supported blockchains
2. A network of Klaster Nodes that interact with these contracts
3. A protocol for creating and executing Interchain Transactions (iTx)

The key innovation of Klaster is its ability to bundle multiple transactions across different chains into a single Interchain Transaction. This iTx can be signed once by the user and then executed by the Klaster network, significantly simplifying cross-chain interactions.

## How Klaster Works

### Interchain Transactions (iTx)

An Interchain Transaction (iTx) is the core concept of Klaster. It is a bundle of one or more blockchain transactions, designed to be executed on one or more blockchain networks. Each iTx is encoded as a Merkle Tree of "child" transactions, with the iTx hash being the root hash of that Merkle Tree.

This structure allows for efficient verification and execution of complex multi-chain operations.

### Klaster Nodes

Klaster Nodes form the backbone of the Klaster network. They play several crucial roles:

- Receive unsigned iTx bundles from users or dApps
- Provide transaction quotes, including gas estimates and execution timelines
- Generate Interchain Commitments, essentially promising to execute the iTx
- Execute transactions on behalf of users across multiple chains
- Manage gas payments and refunds across different chains

Klaster Nodes act as "Meta Paymasters", allowing users to pay for multi-chain transactions in a single asset on a single chain.

### Execution Process

The process of executing an Interchain Transaction involves several steps:

1. Creation: A user or dApp creates an iTx bundle, specifying the desired operations across different chains.

2. Quoting: The iTx bundle is sent to Klaster Nodes, which provide execution quotes.

3. Selection and Signing: The user selects a quote and signs the iTx.

4. Commitment: The selected Klaster Node generates an Interchain Commitment, promising to execute the iTx.

5. Gossiping: The signed iTx is gossiped to witness nodes in the Klaster network.

6. Execution: The committed Klaster Node executes the transactions on the relevant chains.

7. Refunds: Any excess gas payments are refunded to the user on the respective chains.

### Smart Contract Stack

Klaster leverages existing standards and infrastructure where possible, enhancing compatibility and security:

- Modified ERC-4337 EntryPoint: Klaster uses a wrapper around the standard ERC-4337 EntryPoint contract, allowing for seamless integration with existing account abstraction infrastructure.

- Custom ERC-7579 Validation Module: This module verifies the validity of the Merkle Tree Root hash for a given UserOp, ensuring that only authorized transactions are executed.

- Compatibility with Existing Wallets: Klaster works with existing smart contract wallets that support modular architectures, allowing for easy adoption by users and developers.

## Security Guarantees

Klaster provides robust security guarantees through a combination of cryptographic verification and economic incentives:

1. **Fraudulent Transaction Protection**: 
   The Klaster network cannot execute any transaction that is not part of the signed iTx Merkle Tree. This is enforced by smart contracts on the destination chains, ensuring that users' assets are protected from unauthorized transactions.

2. **Censorship Protection and Liveness Guarantees**: 
   Users have two layers of protection against potential censorship:
   - Direct Execution: Users can force execution of their own transactions by calling the execute function on their destination Smart Contract Account.
   - Economic Incentives: Nodes are economically incentivized to execute transactions and face slashing if they fail to do so.

### Slashing Mechanism

The slashing mechanism is a critical component of Klaster's security model. If a Klaster Node fails to execute a transaction it has committed to, it can be slashed. This process works as follows:

1. Detection: Witness nodes monitor the blockchain and detect non-execution of a committed transaction.

2. Slashing Call: Witness nodes call the `slash` function on the StakeManager contract, providing proof of the node's commitment and failure to execute.

3. Stake Reduction: If enough stake is committed to slashing (determined by a threshold value), the offending node loses a portion of its staked tokens.

:::info
The slashing mechanism ensures that Klaster Nodes have a strong economic incentive to fulfill their commitments, providing users with reliable transaction execution.

## Key Benefits

Klaster offers several significant benefits for users and developers in the blockchain ecosystem:

- **Single-signature Multi-chain Transactions**: Users can execute complex cross-chain actions with just one signature, greatly simplifying the user experience.

- **Gas Abstraction**: Users can pay for gas on one chain in one asset, while executing transactions across multiple chains. This eliminates the need for users to hold native tokens on every chain they interact with.

- **Improved UX**: By abstracting away the complexity of interacting with multiple chains, Klaster significantly enhances the user experience for decentralized applications.

- **Compatibility**: Klaster works with existing smart contract wallets and infrastructure, allowing for easier adoption and integration.

- **Optimistic Execution**: Klaster Nodes use an optimistic execution procedure to handle dependent transactions efficiently, improving the overall user experience.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Optimistic iTx Execution

Klaster implements an Optimistic iTx Execution Procedure to handle dependent transactions efficiently:

1. For each UserOp in an iTx bundle, the Klaster Node simulates the full execution trace.

2. The node periodically runs the simulation and waits for the earliest of two conditions:
   - The UserOp execution time frame is nearly over.
   - The UserOp detailed simulation contains no REVERT opcodes.

3. This approach allows the node to execute transactions in the most sensible order without needing to understand the specific dependencies between operations.

4. A diminishing success tip incentivizes nodes to execute transactions as soon as they become valid, optimizing for both speed and correctness.

The Optimistic Execution model allows Klaster to handle complex, interdependent transactions across multiple chains without requiring the nodes to understand the specific logic of each operation.

### Gas Refunds

Klaster implements a sophisticated gas refund mechanism to ensure users only pay for the resources they actually use:

1. Users initially pay a maximum estimated gas cost for the entire iTx bundle.

2. As each UserOp is executed, the actual gas used is calculated.

3. The difference between the estimated and actual gas cost (minus the Klaster Node fee) is refunded to the user on the respective chain.

4. This "multichain refund" system ensures fair pricing across all involved chains.

## Future Developments

The Klaster team is actively exploring several potential improvements to further enhance the protocol:

### Storage Proofs

Implementation of storage proofs would allow for unified staking and slashing across all supported blockchains. This would simplify the node operation process and potentially increase the security of the network.

### Keystore Rollup Support

Integration with the Minimal Keystore Rollup specification could enable more efficient synchronization of state across multiple blockchains. This would move the security of state synchronization from crypto-economic security (staking and slashing) to cryptographic proof security.

### Liquidity Fronting

Future versions of Klaster may allow nodes to provide liquidity for actual asset movements between different chains, in addition to gas. This could potentially improve the user experience by eliminating waiting times associated with traditional bridge operations.
