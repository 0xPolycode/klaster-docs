## Multichain Token Mapping

Klaster is a multichain first framework, and as such - all objects within it are made to work in a multichain environment. One
of the core aspects of working with blockchain system is interacting with tokens. In the EVM ecosystem, these are primarily
ERC20 or ERC721 tokens (with certain subtypes which also comply to these two interfaces).

Since the Klaster SDK wishes to achieve things like unified balances, which can be spent from any chain to any chain - we must
provide it with a way to _map_ like tokens to eachother.

This is achieved through the use of a simple `MultichainTokenMapping` object, which simply maps the addresses of a desired token
across multiple chains. The way you build a multichain token mapping is the following:

```ts
const mcUSDC = buildTokenMapping([
  deployment(optimism.id, "0x<USDC-ON-OPTIMISM-ADDRESS>"),
  deployment(base.id, "0x<USDC-ON-OPTIMISM-ADDRESS>"),
  deployment(arbitrum.id, "0x<USDC-ON-ARBITRUM-ADDRESS>"),
  //... add rest of the chains
]);
```

Then, in a function such as `getUnifiedBalance` or `encodeBridgingData` - you simply pass the `mcUSDC` object and the SDK knows
how to handle the token on mutliple blockchains.

### Notes

Some of the things to note with the MultichainTokenMapping object:

- Only one token deployment is supported per chain
- All deployments must have the same number of decimals
