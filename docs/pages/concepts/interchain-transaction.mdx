## Interchain Transaction

The `InterchainTransaction` or `iTx` is the beating heart of the Klaster protocol. It's an object containing two or more
transactions to be executed on one or more blockchain networks - encoded in a merkle tree.

#### Details 

- The leafs of the tree are the transactions contained in the interchain transaction. They define all of the actions which can be
executed by the iTx.

- The root hash of the merkle tree is called the **Interchain Transaction Hash**

- Every `iTx` is uniquely defined by it's iTx hash

- In order to execute the `iTx`, the user signs the `iTx hash` with their private key and sends the signed hash, together with
the list of the `leaf` transactions - to a Klaster Node.

- The first transaction in the `iTx` is always the transaction fee payment transaction.
