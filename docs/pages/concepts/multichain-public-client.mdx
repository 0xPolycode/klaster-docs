## Multichain Public Client

In order to achieve certain functionalities, such as fetching a unified multichain balance or encoding bridging strategies - the 
Klaster SDK must have the ability to read from the blockchains with which your application is interacting with. 

To achieve this, the Klaster SDK counts on the `MultichainClient` object. This object is a simple mapping of `rpcUrl` to
`chainId`. As of version `0.5.2` - the `MultichainClient` exposes a utility function to read the unified balance of an
`ERC20` token (provided by a [TokenMapping](./multichain-token-mapping.mdx) object).

A multichain public client can be easily built by leveraging the `buildMultichainReadonlyClient` function.

```ts
const mcClient = buildMultichainReadonlyClient([
  buildRpcInfo(optimism.id, 'https://optimism-rpc'),
  buildRpcInfo(base.id, 'https://base-rpc'),
  //... add the rest of the chains
])
```
