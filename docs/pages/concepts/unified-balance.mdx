## Unified Balance

A `UnifiedBalance` object contains the balance of some `ERC20` token across multiple blockchains. It can be fetched by calling
the `getUnifiedErc20Balance` function on the `MultichainClient` object. 

```ts
type UnifiedBalance = {
  balance: bigint // total balance across all blockchains
  decimals: number // the number of decimals of the token for which the unified balance is fetched
  breakdown: { // breakdown of balances across all queried blockchains
    balance: bigint,
    chainId: number
  }[]
}
```
